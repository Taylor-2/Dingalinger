V, S
1 Minute
A spectral, floating hand appears at a point you choose within range. The hand lasts for the duration or until you dismiss it as an action. The hand vanishes if it's ever more than 30' away from you or if you cast the spell again. You can use your action to control the hand. You can us the hand to manipulate an object, open an unlocked door or container, stow or retrieve an item from an open container, or pour the contents out of a vial. You can move the hand up to 30' each time you use it. The hand can't attack, activate magic items, or carry more than 10 pounds.
